  <summary>What is metadata? Why is it relevant?</summary>
  
Metadata describes data by providing essential information that helps in its understanding. This can include administrative metadata such as the creator or creation date, etc, or more detailed information beyond the administrative ones e.g. how the data was produced like the used technique, the instrument’s manufacturer,... Metadata can be unstructured, which doesn’t adhere to a specific template, or structured, which follows a defined template. To enhance the findability and reusability of the data, it is important that metadata follows a specification defined by a metadata schema.
