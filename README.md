# (Meta)data Management Cookbook
The (Meta)data Management Cookbook is a simple and practical guide which walks users through the key phases of the (meta)data management process based on the FAIR principles. 
Its scope is to give a basic understanding of the (meta)data management process as well as to provide practical use cases that users can follow. 
This cookbook highlights services developed and offered by  [Scientific Computing Center](https://www.scc.kit.edu) (SCC), the Information Technology Center of the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu) (KIT). 
These tools are customized to meet the specific requirements of different projects.
